MotorsportPlus is designed to enhance and augment the existing UI with new features and additions for players of all disciplines.
SimHub is required to be installed for the overlay to function.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Install SimHub: https://www.simhubdash.com/download-2/ (A restart will be required to finish install.)
  - You must be at version 9.1.1 or newer, or SimHub will not recognise FM.
LOADING THE DASH MODULES:
  - Included with MotorsportPlus is the modules themselves, denoted by the SimHub icon and .simhubdash file extension.
  - Double clicking these files will bring a pop-up window to install the modules. Install all bundled modules.
  - Ensure that "Install Fonts" is ticked, before clicking "Import into SimHub Library".
- Copy the 'OverlayLayouts' folder contents into your SimHub install folder of the same name.
CONFIGURING THE GAME: 
- Go to Settings > Gameplay & HUD, and enter the following settings:
  - Data Out: On
  - Data Out IP Address: 127.0.0.1
  - Data Out IP Port: 8000
  - Data Out Packet Format: Car Dash
- Start the Overlay in Dash Studio > Overlays > MotorsportPlus.
  - The given preset is for 1080p on a second monitor. Please reach out if you have a different setup and are willing to contribute a layout file.
